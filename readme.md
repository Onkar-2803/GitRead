- Pass the path of cloned repo to get_dependencies.py
- Run the get_dependencies.py to get versions of dependencies
- You can run the same code in your other project repositaries to get the versions of dependencies.
- We can also automate the whole process by getting dependencies of all commits(using GitPython)
