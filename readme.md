Clone the repo.  
Install requirements.  
Make some changes to 'changes.py' file, push those changes. (To create first commit)
Get the commit hash and pass it to get_dependencies.py
Pass the path of cloned repo to get_dependencies.py
Run the get_dependencies.py to get versions of dependencies
You can run the same code in your other project repositaries to get the versions of dependencies.
We can also automate the whole process by getting dependencies of all commits(using GitPython)
